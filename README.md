# starwars-game-c
This is a shooting type of a game which i made in c++ during my school days as a project,
Just copy this code and save the file as .cpp and simply run the file in turbo c++ and you are free to enjoy the game ,
All the instruction to the game can be seen after running the game and are pretty simple and straught forward,
I hope that you like and enjoy the game
